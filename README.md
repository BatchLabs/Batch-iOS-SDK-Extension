# Batch SDK - iOS (Extension)

This repository contains Batch's iOS Extension SDK.

It is a light version that only uses Extension-safe APIs. It provides Rich Push capabilities and other functionality.

The project is written in Swift 5, but Objective-C projects are supported.
If you do not have Swift code in your app and do not want to bundle the Swift runtime on versions lower than iOS 12.2,
use Batch-iOS-SDK-Extension-ObjC.

## Requirements

- iOS 10 and higher
- Xcode 11 and higher

### Cocoapods

### Carthage

### Swift Package Manager

Add `https://github.com/BatchLabs/Batch-iOS-SDK-Extension.git` as a dependency, and add it to your Extension target.
You do not need to add this package to your main target.
